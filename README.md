[![Run Rubocop](https://github.com/AlphaNodes/redmine_ref_issues/workflows/Run%20Rubocop/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AlphaNodes/redmine_ref_issues/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Run+Rubocop%22) [![Run Brakeman](https://github.com/AlphaNodes/redmine_ref_issues/workflows/Run%20Brakeman/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AlphaNodes/redmine_ref_issues/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Run+Brakeman%22) [![Run Tests](https://github.com/AlphaNodes/redmine_ref_issues/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AlphaNodes/redmine_ref_issues/actions?query=workflow%3ATests)

## Features

- one macro to create issue lists
  - with existing issue queries
  - with parameters (without issue queries)

This is a fork of [redmine_wiki_lists](https://github.com/tkusukawa/redmine_wiki_lists), which reduce functionality to just one macro - ref_issues

## Requirements

- Redmine `>= 6.1.0`
- Ruby `>= 3.2`

## Installing

1. Clone this repository into `redmine/plugins/redmine_ref_issues`.

   ```shell
   cd redmine
   git clone https://github.com/alphanodes/redmine_ref_issues.git plugins/redmine_ref_issues
   bundle config set --local without 'development test'
   bundle install
   ```

   if you have older Redmine version (5.0 - 6.0), use:

      ```shell
      cd redmine
      git clone -b stable https://github.com/alphanodes/redmine_ref_issues.git plugins/redmine_ref_issues
      bundle config set --local without 'development test'
      bundle install
      ```

2. Restart your Redmine application server.

## Settings

The plugin has an admin settings page (*Administration > Plugins > Configure*) with one option:

- **Silence errors instead of raising exceptions**: when enabled, errors raised by the `ref_issues` macro
  (invalid parameters, unknown filters, query errors, ...) are logged to the Rails log and the macro renders
  nothing, instead of showing an error message on the page. Disabled by default.

## Usage

Syntax

```PowerShell
{{ref_issues([option].., [column]..)}}
```

Options

```text
-s[=WORD[｜WORD]..]
select issues that contain WORDs in subject.

-d[=WORD[｜WORD]..]
select issues that contain WORDs in description.
　
-w[=WORD[｜WORD]..]
select issues that contain WORDs in subject or description.

-p[=IDENTIFIRE]
Specify the project by identifire.

-i=CUSTOM_QUERY_ID
Use custom query by id.

-q=CUSTOM_QUERY_NAME
Use custom query by query name.

-0
Do not display the table If query result is 0.

f:<ATTRIBUTE>␣<OPERATOR>␣<[VALUE[|VALUE...]]>
filter. Attributes are shown below.
e.x. {{ref_issues(-f:tracker_id = 3)}}
　
[ATTRIBUTE]
issue_id,tracker_id,project_id,subject,description,
due_date,category_id,status_id,assigned_to_id,priority_id,
fixed_version_id,author_id,lock_version,created_on,updated_on,
start_date,done_ratio,estimated_hours,parent_id,root_id,
lft,rgt,is_private,closed_on,
cf_*,

tracker,category,status,assigned_to,version,project,
treated, author

[OPERATOR]
=:is, !:is not, o:open, c:closed, !*:none,
*:any, >=:>=, <=:<=, ><:between, >t+:in more than,
>w:this week, lw:last week, l2w:last 2 weeks, m:this month, lm:last month,
y:this year, >t-:less than days ago, ~:contains, !~:doesn't contain,
=p:any issues in project, =!p:any issues not in project, !p:no issues in project,

**Note:** Multiple filter options for different fields create AND conditions. See the "AND/OR Logic" section below for detailed examples.

If you use this macro in a Issue, you can use the field value of the issue as VALUE by writing to the following field(column) name in the [] (brackets).
> Besides [<column>], You can use [id], [current_project_id], [current_user], [current_user_id], [<number> days_ago] .
　
-l[=column]
Put linked text.
　
-t[=column]
Put markup text.

-sum[=column]
Sum of specified column for issues.
　
-c
number of issues.
```

### AND/OR Logic

Understanding how filters combine is important for creating the right queries:

**AND logic (multiple filter fields):**

When you specify multiple `-f:` options with **different fields**, they are combined with AND logic:

```PowerShell
{{ref_issues(-f:tracker = Bug, -f:status = New)}}
```

This finds issues where tracker is "Bug" **AND** status is "New".

**OR logic (pipe separator within one filter):**

Use the pipe `|` separator to create OR conditions **within a single field**:

```PowerShell
{{ref_issues(-f:tracker = Bug|Feature)}}
```

This finds issues where tracker is "Bug" **OR** "Feature".

**Limitation with contains operator (`~`):**

When using the contains operator `~` on the **same field multiple times**, you cannot achieve AND logic:

```PowerShell
# This does NOT work as expected (will not find issues containing BOTH words):
{{ref_issues(-f:cf_51 ~ oracle, -f:cf_51 ~ linux)}}

# Use pipe for OR instead:
{{ref_issues(-f:cf_51 ~ oracle|linux)}}
```

This is a limitation of Redmine's Query system. To search for multiple words in a custom field where ALL words must be present, consider using Redmine's built-in search or a custom query instead.

**OR logic between different fields (Workaround):**

Currently, OR logic between **different fields** is not supported directly in the macro syntax:

```PowerShell
# This does NOT work (will use AND logic, not OR):
{{ref_issues(-f:author = [current_user], -f:assigned_to = [current_user])}}
```

**Workaround using Custom Queries:**

To achieve OR logic between different fields (e.g., "author OR assigned_to"), create a custom query in Redmine's web interface with the desired OR filters, then reference it by name or ID:

```PowerShell
# Create a custom query in Redmine UI with OR filters, then:
{{ref_issues(-q=MyOrQuery)}}
# or
{{ref_issues(-i=42)}}
```

This is a limitation of Redmine's Query API which does not support OR conjunctions between different filter fields programmatically.

### column

You can choose columns that you want to display.
If you do not specify the columns, same columns with customquery are displayed.

- project
- tracker
- parent
- status
- priority
- subject
- author
- assigned_to
- updated_on
- category
- fixed_version
- start_date
- due_date
- estimated_hours
- done_ratio
- created_on
- closed_on
- relations

### Examples

1. Use custom query by ID

   ```PowerShell
   {{ref_issues(-i=9)}}
   ```

2. Use custom query by name

   ```PowerShell
   {{ref_issues(-q=MyCustomQuery1)}}
   ```

3. List up issues that contain 'sorting' in subject

   ```PowerShell
   {{ref_issues(-f:subject ~ sorting)}}
   ```

4. List up issues that author_id is 1 and status is not 'To Do'. specify display column(project,subject,author,assigned_to,status)

   ```PowerShell
   {{ref_issues(-f:author_id = 1, -f:status ! To Do, project, subject, author, assigned_to, status)}}
   ```

5. List up tickets that tracker is Support(3) or Question(6), and restrict by project=Wiki Lists

   ```PowerShell
   {{ref_issues(-f:tracker == Question | Support, -f:project = Wiki Lists)}}
   ```

6. Pickup issues that have subject=Sample, and put linked ID

   ```PowerShell
   {{ref_issues(-f:subject = Sample, -l=id)}}
   ```

7. Pickup issues that have subject=Sample, and put markuped description

   ```PowerShell
   {{ref_issues(-f:subject = Sample, -t=description)}}
   ```

8. Put number of issues that contain 'sorting' in subject

   ```PowerShell
   {{ref_issues(-f:subject ~ sorting, -c)}}
   ```

9. Filter by issue_id (between)

     ```PowerShell
     {{ref_issues(-f:issue_id >< 1389|1391)}}
     ```

10. Filter by issue_id (or)

     ```PowerShell
    {{ref_issues(-f:issue_id == 1389|1391)}}
    ```

11. Do not display the table If query result is 0.

    ```PowerShell
    {{ref_issues(-0,-f:subject = Sample2)}}
    ```

12. OR condition by name

    ```PowerShell
    {ref_issues(-f:category == sample|error, subject, category)}}
    ```

13. Created or updated by user jsmith from 2017-05-01 to yesterday

    ```PowerShell
    {{ref_issues(-f:treated jsmith 2017-05-01|[1days_ago])}}
    ```

14. Put sum of estimated_hours of issues that contain 'sorting' in subject

    ```PowerShell
    {{ref_issues(-f:subject ~ sorting, -sum:estimated_hours)}}
    ```

15. List overdue issues (due date in the past)

    ```PowerShell
    {{ref_issues(-f:due_date <t- 0)}}
    ```

16. List issues due in more than 5 days

    ```PowerShell
    {{ref_issues(-f:due_date >t+ 5)}}
    ```

17. List issues due in less than 3 days

    ```PowerShell
    {{ref_issues(-f:due_date <t+ 3)}}
    ```
